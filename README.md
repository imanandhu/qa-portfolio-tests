# QA Automation Projects

This repository contains my hands-on automation testing projects using Java (Selenium/TestNG), Cypress (JavaScript), Postman (API), K6 (Performance), and Burp Suite (Security Testing). These are simplified examples based on real scenarios Iâ€™ve worked on in B2B SaaS environments.
- Selenium with Java & TestNG
- Cypress with JavaScript
- Postman for API testing
- K6 for performance testing
- Burp Suite for security validation

## Structure

- `selenium-java-testng`: UI automation using Selenium & TestNG
- `cypress-tests`: UI automation using Cypress
- `postman-api-tests`: API collection for testing
